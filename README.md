# knot-potential-surfaces
Python code to visualize level surfaces of potential for electrically charged knots.

Update 7/2/20:
Added code to compute the critical sets of the potentials.

Update 7/9/20:
Added a Python file with all the functionality for convenience. The file also comes with a function for generating animations of evolving level surfaces, using multiprocessing.


Runs on Python 3, and requires Mayavi:
